Being  a  visual  artist  means  you  need  to  deal  with  color.  Against  our  instinct,  color  is  actually   complecated.  To  begin  with,  every  color  we  see  is  a  combination  of  hue,  lightness  and  purity. They  each  are  senced  by  our  eyes  seperately  but  mixed  into  a  coherent  perception,  and  the whole  process  happens  smoothly  without  our conciouse  awareness. But  as  a visual artist,  being able to distinguish these components are essential. You need to be color sensitive to be good at visual art,  although it  dosenâ€™t  ganrentee  your  excellence. It  would be  helpful  to  quickly  find out how sensitive you are with color. 

This app we are interested in would be able to help you test your color sensitivity. You can take a quick  test  on  the  app,  and get  a evaluation  of  your  strength  and  weakness.  It would  be  a good starting point for you to work your way toward excellence.
